    "   - **Cons**: Doesn't leverage varianceâ€”if the data has low variance or small residuals, this inequality might overestimate the probability of deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bennett's inequality**:\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "### Practical Meaning\n",
    "If your model has small residuals or variance, Hoeffding's inequality won't recognize this and will provide a conservative bound. In contrast, Bennett's inequality \"takes advantage\" of the favorable situation (low variance) to offer a more precise probability bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "- **Hoeffding** is \"rough\" because it's overly cautious and doesn't adapt to data properties.\n",
    "- **Bennett** is \"stronger\" because it uses extra information to sharpen its estimates."
